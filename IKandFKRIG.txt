Adding two parent constraints on one object between two parents shares parentage 50 percent. 
Can change weight of object in the channel editor to change how much parent influences. 

Creat FK rig. Duplicate joint chain. then build IK System. DONT MOVE IT

RK joint - recieves kinematics. No controls only parented. 

Modify-Search and replace L or R or Ik or Fk

Constrain IK base to last joint in spine

Place IK handle in IK under control
 
Once both IK and FK 

Select IK, FK, and RK do parent/ scale constraint.

Select transform control( main control), add attribute. name it along with limb. IK is 0 FK is 1
Create set driven key Load Driver. Key all RK constraints. Load Driven. Select driven key arm attribute, 
then parent IK FK attribute in channel editor to 0 and 1. Key them. 

Load control visibility as well
